  h1 Concept 
  p 
    | Autocracy is a self-governance platform. While it does not aim to replace national governments, it enables communities, local or otherwise distributed,
    | to partly govern themselves as they choose. Its main functionalities include:
  ul 
    li Maintaining a registry of rules.
    li Maintaining a registry of members.
    li Collecting and managing funds and other shared resources
    li Voting for rules or representatives.

  h2 Ecosystem architecture 
  p 
    | At the top level, Autocracy is designed as several products. First, the core of Autocracy is the organisational hub.
    | This part of the software is capable of hosting multiple organisations. Of course, it can also host a single organisation if desired,
    | but the point of this is to enable regional hubs for small organisations lacking the resources to set up a dedicated hub.
    | An organisational registry maintains a list of all active (and public) organisations, regularly polling known organisational hubs.
  p 
    | The software of an organisation instance is designed with a modular philosophy in mind, acting merely as a framework to plug components into for various functionality.
    | For instance, different voting or leadership mechanisms can be plugged in. In fact, one can even query dedicated third party services!
